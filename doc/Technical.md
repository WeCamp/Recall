#Technical#

##Chosen technology stack##

We chose the following technical stack based on experience of our team **The Avengers**, two of the team
already had experience with Silex and the remaining developer was keen to learn something new. Many of
the choices were to gain time from requiring little or no set up on our existing developer machines or
minimal research overhead. As a team we wanted to focus on achieving something towards the philosophy of
the project, rather than getting stuck with technical issues with environment set up. Our only technical
unknown at the start of the project was selection of the appropriate library to interact with Git.

1. PHP (including PHP's built in web server)
2. Git as the backend storage mechanism
3. Git-Wrapper library (Packagist: cpliakas/git-wrapper)
4. Composer
5. PSR-0 / PSR-2
6. Pimple
7. Twitter Bootstrap
8. jQuery
9. Silex
10. Twig
11. Symfony console component
