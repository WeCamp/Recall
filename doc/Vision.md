#Vision for Recall#
##A project from team The Avengers##

Our initial project ideas came from recollection, by a couple of members of the team, of Rasmus Lerdorf's
DPC '12 and PHPDay.it '14 Keynote presentations, which encouraged us as developers to try 'to add Value or
Meaning in our projects' - we strongly felt this concept influenced the rest of our discussions during
project selection.

Another concept that emerged was that of Siloed data, the concept of peoples' data being locked away and
essentially becoming the property of corporations, in turn this moved us to consider the Indie data
movement. From there we contemplated how to move the data back in to the hands of users, inverting the
locus of control and consequences for both the user and the corporations.

Several key phrases emerged that are embodied in project Recall:

* It's mine to mine
* Reclaim privacy
* I am the stream
* Github for life

We gave consideration to the TinCan API that has emerged in the education arena, allowing people to take
their learning record data sets between education providers. This concept was widened out to look at other
areas of life:

* Birth -> Death
* Life history
* Professional history (where an output might be a resume/CV)
* Family (including merges/splits through events like marriage/divorce)
* Healthcare - decentralised storage of my health events
* Insurance - recording serial nos. of things you own, to get better insurance quotes or claims
* Groceries - comparing between supermarkets for 'my usual basket'

The principles of Decentralised Architecture with Centralised Aggregators emerged (how for example Facebook
could subscribe to our data, instead of us parting with our data and Facebook deciding what happens to it)

We decided, for the duration of the [Wecamp](http://weca.mp) timescale to focus on one single area of development, Healthcare.
In turn that set us on the path to developing the [Personas](UserStories.md) to scope the project detail.
